# BookXs Eâ€‘Library 

Minimal, standards-compliant website to explore BookXs libraries across India and manage books. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL.

## Quick Setup (XAMPP)

- Place this folder at `c:\xampp\htdocs\BookX` (already done).
- Create MySQL database named `e_library` via phpMyAdmin.
- Import `database/e_library.sql` into `e_library`.
- Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP.
- Visit `http://localhost/BookX/`.

### Default Admin

- Email: `admin@bookxs.com`
- Password: `admin123`

## Project Structure

See the folders and files within this repository. No frameworks are used; only Font Awesome CDN for icons.

## Notes

- User login requires name, email, and location (city/state). Nearest library is suggested by city match.
- Borrow/purchase adjusts availability where appropriate.
- Code adheres to W3C HTML5 semantics and minimal styling for a clean UX.
